/**
 * This package contains the classes that implement the discrete stochastic
 * simulation.
 * It provides a simulation that contains multiple events that are executed over
 * time.
 * The events are executed in order of their timestamp.
 * The events can be of different types.
 * The simulation ends when the maximum time is reached.
