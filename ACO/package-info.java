/**
 * This package contains the classes that implement the Ant Colony Optimization
 * algorithm.
 * It provides an ant colony that contains multiple ants that traverse a graph
 * and find the shortest path between two nodes.
 * The ants communicate with each other by leaving pheromones on the edges of
 * the graph.
 * The pheromones evaporate over time.
 * The ants choose the next node to visit based on the pheromone levels and the
 * distance between the nodes.
